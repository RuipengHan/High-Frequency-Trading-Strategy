SimpleMomentumStrategy is a sample strategy for implementing a basic directional algorithm on a batch of symbols.

This strategy subscribes to bars for whatever symbols are defined for the instance of the strategy. For each instrument,
it maintains a Momentum calculation as the difference in the SMA of a shorter and longer term rolling window of prices. 
If the short term SMA is above the long term SMA it will go long, otherwise it will go short. This example illustrates the 
use of limit orders withing the Strategy Studio API, along with establishing StrategyCommands to control updating or canceling the 
limit orders.

WARNING: The Strategy Studio example strategies are for documentation purposes only. They are not intended to produce profits
and should not be used for production trading. This strategy is not meant to indicate any opinion on whether momentum
or reversion are viable strategies on any time horizon.
