# IE 498 Group 1 Project Proposal

Author: Ruipeng Han, Yihong Jian, Tommy Kimura, Zihan Zhou

## Introduction:

For the final project, we will be implementing a HFT strategy(strategies) that trades on real world market data, back test it using Strategy Studio, and analyze performance. We will first obtain historical data from IEX, Nasdaq database, and alpaca (other exchanges). Then, we will write a parse to convert these data into Strategy Studio format. After that, we will draft actual trading strategies (Prof will give us the strategy) in C++ and confirm that it works. Finally, we will draft scripts to automate the process and generate performance reports.
## Technologies:
### Data parse

- Python
- Alpaca-trade-api

### Implement strategy

### Automation

- Bash script
- python script

### Visualization

Extra week for safety

## Job Distribution:
For job distribution, we split the work in each weekâ€™s regular meeting. However, each individual teammate will be mainly responsible for a certain task. Specifically, he/she should make sure the task is done for the week and is the go-to person for any issues on the task.
