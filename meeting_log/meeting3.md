# IE498 HFT, Group 01, Meeting 03

## Record about last night

- We are determined to do some trading algo using strategy studio.
  - Another idea is Python wrapper so future ppl don't need to write cpp
- Prof would give us strategies and we just write them in CPP
- VM (strategy studio) setup instructions sent via email
- Data
  - Maybe a python parser (it's easier than CPP probably?)
  - Back test +
